## Introduction ‚úèÔ∏è
This repository is part of the [Bachelor's Thesis: "DayDay, appointment scheduling for clinics"](https://github.com/ins426/TFG) whose code follows the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular and Node.js). It contains the client side corresponding to the 'A' initial, Angular. Apart from Angular, the client side is based on Angular Material, Angular Flex-Layout and RxJS.

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) is an open source framework to create web applications which was developed by Google.
  - [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) which is a library for Angular projects that includes user interfaces components.
  - [Angular Flex-Layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout). It is an Angular library used in order to get responsive interfaces.
- [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), a Javascript library that applies Observable software pattern to work with events. This is used in the Calendar main view, so if there is any change, the page needn't to be reloaded.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Open source technology that allows to distribute software as containers, it is used to automatize platform's deployment in an easy way. [Here](https://github.com/ins426/TFG/blob/main/README.md#tools-) is explained how to launch the frontend with the backend side.
